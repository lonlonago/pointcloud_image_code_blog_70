When you first came into contact with HTML, were you surprised by its many tags? In particular, HTNL5 tags have been added a lot, and many HTML4 tags will not be used after cross-version. It is impossible to remember so many tags. We only need some commonly used tags, and the rest can be queried when used.

 But sometimes the technical webpages that I collect are often 404. Although you can go to Baidu, you have to look it up line by line. So lazy people like me always want to do it once and for all. I used to organize some things that I might use in my work into document notes and upload them to my online disk and GitHub.  

Today, I will share with you the HTML5 tag notes that I have sorted out before, and provide the source documentation. When you need it, you can Ctrl + F to find keywords, and you can also make your own remarks by the way. 

Without further ado, go directly to the goods!
