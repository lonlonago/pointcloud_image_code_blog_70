Python has once again won the title of "programming language of the year" by TIBOE, becoming the most popular programming language in 2021. Although I have always been optimistic about C #in 2021, I can't deny the global data thing, but I am not surprised at all. Instead, I am more convinced of certain things.

Although the trend of Python is only increasing, there are some things that are not clear to everyone. Although Uncle Long has written many articles about Python, it does not mean that I have to praise it. There is a reason why Python has such a high popularity and ranking. I hope my sharing this time can solve some doubts for everyone. 

###  The reasons why Python is gaining momentum may not be obvious to some people 

Many people think that the reason why Python has become popular is the rise of artificial intelligence and big data, but I think this is not the whole reason. Although Python is a programming language that is very suitable for the field of artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence is still in the early stage, and there is still a long way to go before the real landing, especially in China. Although the number of talents in artificial intelligence is increasing, but also because there are not many positions available, there is no graduate degree or above. No matter how good you learn Python, you will not be able to find a job in this area. 

Of course, this doesn't mean that it can't be implemented on a large scale in the future. It just means that if you rely on artificial intelligence and big data alone, Python is far from being as hot as it is now, at least I think so.

So why is Python still stronger than other languages? I think the non-programmer aspect also plays a big role. 

In addition to the C station, I also have accounts on platforms such as Douyin Kuaishou Xiaohongshu. When communicating with many fans on other platforms, I found that they are also learning Python, but they are not programmers and do not want to be programmers. The main reason for learning Python is that Python is easy to learn and can improve work efficiency and workplace competitiveness.

They are positioned to learn Python as an auxiliary tool, and these groups already cover a wide range of positions, including operations, marketing, finance, new media, etc. These positions are in demand in almost every industry, which means that learning Python is no longer exclusive to programmers. 

Going back to the programming language ranking published by TIOBE, if you look closely, you will find that TIOBE's language ranking indicators include courses, the number of third-party providers, and the calculated ratings of major search engines. In fact, whether you are a programmer or not, as long as you are interested in Python and make relevant Internet behaviors, you are likely to contribute a piece of data to this score.

  In fact, the answer here is already obvious. Programmers are just one profession in all walks of life in society, and there are many other professions. If many professions are learning or using a certain language, then the popularity of this language will definitely rise. In contrast to other programming languages such as C language, it is rare to hear that there are non-programmers who say they want to learn and use it in their work, so the popularity gap between Python and other languages is widened. 

The reason why Python is gaining so much momentum is that it also has a large data impact on non-programmers. 

This actually reflects some problems, since there are a lot of data from outside the industry, then in the IT industry, Python has not yet reached the appearance of the above so strong, at least at present can not shake the Java and other big-name languages, so want to be a programmer, the Java or continue to learn your Java, want to learn C #to learn C #, there is no need because of the strength of Python feel confused or deny anything. 

I don't mean to discredit Python, and it doesn't do me any good. I just want more people to have a good idea and look at current trends rationally. 

###  Second, should I learn Python? 

There are a lot of people who start to say "Python is seriously overrated", "Python has its own appearance, in fact, it can't do anything", and some people say "you can't find a job learning Python", some people may be very torn, so should you learn Python? 

I think it is extreme and undesirable to overhype Python, but is it not misleading to overly deny it? 

Can Python find a job on the recruitment website a search will know, I here to worry about the future as an example, were searched for Java, C++ and Python three keywords, the results are as follows: 

![avatar]( d4913482db67469fb87af1e0b4f63ba2.png) 

Java is currently the most used programming language on the market, recruitment needs have 1614 pages; C++ page is the old recruitment needs of a large programming language, there are 1260 pages; and the so-called Python can not find a job, the search results have reached 1012 pages, if learning Python can not find a job, then these recruitment is for those who can not breathe to see? 

If you say that learning PHP is hard to find or can't find a job, I can still understand, because its recruitment requirements are currently only more than 100 pages in the country, but Python is almost ten times that much. The daily data of the recruitment platform will not be the work of a certain organization, right? 

The original intention of making Python was not to use it to compare speed and performance, but to make it easier for more people to use it to solve problems, so there is no need to compare it with a certain language in terms of its incompetence.

Just like using a small bridge car and a large truck to compare speed or load, there is no comparison at all, and the positioning is different. What is the point of comparison? It is the most important thing to be able to solve the actual needs. 

Therefore, it is more rational to choose whether to learn Python or not. 

Python is still very good in crawling, data analytics, automated testing, and artificial intelligence (note what I said earlier), and there are many job requirements. Those who want to learn Python can consider these aspects.

 Of course, if you only want to use Python as an auxiliary tool or a secondary skill, there's nothing to talk about. Just learn it. Python is really useful.
