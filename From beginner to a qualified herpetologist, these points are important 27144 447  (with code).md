Do you know a few parsing libraries or a little bit of framework knowledge to become a crawler? No, in fact, a qualified crawler is not as simple as he thinks. It takes time and technology to precipitate and constantly polish programming skills. 

So today I'm going to tell you "What skills do you need to learn to go from beginner to qualified reptilian.

###  First, the Python language 

Any programming technology requires language support. Among the many computer programming languages, it is not said that only Python can be used for crawling, it is not the only one, such as Java, C, etc. These can be used for crawling development, but in contrast, Python is the most suitable for crawling development. 

The Python language is the foundation, and if you have a solid grasp of the basic knowledge, there will be no problem in the later learning. Then one of the more important knowledge points at this stage is "object-oriented programming thinking", which is the most difficult thing. Therefore, students can spend more time on this stage of the Python language, and they must have programming thinking, so that the following things can get twice the result with half the effort.

###  Programming Linux environment 

Linux has always been a leader in the server field, which is largely due to its stability, security and low total cost of ownership, and whether it is a web project in the enterprise, or a database, and the deployment of crawlers, not to mention big data processing, and even artificial intelligence, the vast majority of them run in Linux system, so lay a good Linux foundation is a must-have skill. 

We can Linux, familiar with the relevant common commands, such as learning how to configure Linux system network, common basic commands, or skilled administrators of Linux systems, after all, we are to do professional crawlers, not operation and maintenance.

###  III. Database programming 

All projects rely on databases, which are essential skills for programmers, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, etc. However, the most widely used database is MySQL. 

But no matter what kind of database you learn, whether it is MySQL or SQLserver, SQL language is something we must firmly grasp, such as the most basic addition, deletion, modification, and search of databases, as well as the design ideas and three paradigms of databases (1NF~ 3NF).

###  IV. Web programming 

Nowadays, we are familiar with the B/S architecture and the C/S architecture. These two architectures vary widely in terms of hardware environment, security requirements, program architecture, and processing issues. The current browser implementation shows that most of them are based on the B/C architecture. At the same time, web programming is also a skill that every programmer must understand. 

For a crawler, we don't need to say that we want to be as proficient as a front-end programmer, but we also need to be familiar with this part.

###  Django Web Framework 

We all know that Django is a Python-based web development framework. So first of all, we need to specify what web development is. Web development refers to the development of applications based on B/S architecture that display the data of the back-end server to the front-end user through the cooperation of the front-end and back-end. 

Django is an open-source web framework written in Python with full web capabilities. With Django, you can easily complete most of the content required for a website with very little code, and further develop a fully functional web service.

###  Tornado programming framework 

Tornado is the open source version of our web server and its common tools at FriendFeed. Tornado and the current mainstream web server frameworks (including most Python frameworks), Tornado is also a commonly used Python web development framework. 

In the process of writing a project, it is common to mix the two frameworks of Django and Torndao, making full use of the convenience and speed of Django and the high load of Tornado to solve practical problems in the project.

###  Seven, mobile end technology 

For a qualified crawler developer, it is not enough to only crawl the data on the web. With the development of the Internet, the data on mobile devices is also of reference value, and the two must be developed in a balanced manner. 

From the basic knowledge of Android, such as what controls Andrond has, as well as network programming and HTTP protocol, six basic principles and common design patterns, etc.

###  Eight, reptile development 

In recent years, with the development of big data and artificial intelligence, especially artificial intelligence, there is an increasing demand for crawler engineers. Experienced crawler engineers can easily start at 20k. Postgraduate degrees in artificial intelligence will have great advantages and require further study. 

Speaking of which, we also need to understand the most basic crawler principles and routines, understand the various problems of web crawler programming, deal with anti-crawler technology, be able to deal with dynamic website crawling, be able to deal with websites with verification codes, and so on.

###  And finally. 

We still have a long way to go on the crawler road. I hope you will persevere and continue to refine your skills, and eventually become a qualified crawler engineer. 

Technology is not guilty, but if you crawl around, you will get caught.
