Dear friends, hello everyone. Uncle Long, I often receive private messages in the background asking what is Python? Is it necessary to learn this language? Today, I will tell you what Python is and how to learn it through this article? If you are also interested in python, please subscribe to my column. If you think my article is well written, remember to give me a like and support! 

##  What is Python?

Python is an object oriented, interpreted high-level programming language with concise, clear, and easy-to-read syntax, which is widely used in web development, data science, and artificial intelligence. 

Python's design philosophy emphasizes readability and simplicity. Because Python code is particularly readable, it is widely used in many fields because it is very efficient to develop and maintain applications in Python. At the same time, Python also has a large community and excellent third-party libraries and frameworks, which can easily complete the development of various tasks and projects. 

##  Origin of Python

 When many people hear the word python, the first thing that comes to mind is the python, so why is python called python (python)? We have to ask this boss - Guido van Rossum  

Guido van Rossum created Python in order to solve the problems he faced at the Amsterdam Institute (CWI). At the time, CWI's IT system did not have a development language that could complete various tasks, and various development languages had some limitations and flaws, which annoyed Guido. Therefore, he began to design his own programming language to better solve these problems. During Christmas 1991, he completed the first version of Python and named it after a comedy group called Monty Python from his favorite TV series "Monty Python Flying Circus". After that, he promoted Python within CWI, and it was quickly recognized and used by everyone. Since then, Python has gained popularity and become a globally popular programming language, widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and many other fields. 

##  Why should we learn Python?

According to the six-month programming language rankings for 2023, it is not difficult to find that, regardless of the changes in the rankings of other languages, Python has always occupied the first place. From these data, we can see the popularity of the Python language. 

So why is Python so popular? It depends on its following advantages: 

>  1. Python is an easy-to-learn language, and its syntax is very concise and clear. For beginners, it is easy to master its basic syntax and programming principles.

2. Python has a strong development community and a wide range of application scenarios, which can be used for data analytics, web development, scientific computing, artificial intelligence, etc., covering a wide range of fields.

3. Python is portable and can be used on various operating systems and platforms, whether it is Windows, Linux or MacOS, etc., you can run Python programs.

4. Python has a wealth of third-party modules and libraries, making it easy for developers to use and use more widely.

5. Python is highly customizable, allowing for more complex and advanced programming tasks through a variety of modules and tools. 

What's more, Python has a wealth of data processing libraries and tools: Python has a wealth of data processing libraries and tools, such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, etc. These libraries can help developers quickly process, visualize and analyze data. Today, we are in the era of big data, and we are in contact with big data all the time, so the processing of data becomes particularly important.

##  summarize 

Having said so much, the purpose is to tell everyone that Python is a category that overwhelms other languages in terms of functionality and ease of use. As the most suitable programming language for beginners with zero basics, if you want to learn it, you can't just talk about it on paper. You have to settle down and study it in depth.
