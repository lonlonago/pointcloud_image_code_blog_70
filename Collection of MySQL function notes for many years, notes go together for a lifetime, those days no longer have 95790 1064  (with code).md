###  foreword 

Over the years, I have maintained a habit of organizing my knowledge and making notes. Although we search for a lot of information online, we can find a large number of them, and then collect them if we think they are good, such as some good blogs. When I think about using them, I will read them again. 

But in this process, there will be problems often encountered, such as the collection of articles is missing (deleted), and then to find other articles and have to re-understand the new author's thinking; for example, although I have collected some articles, but some of the articles in the partial content will be outdated, tasteless and discarded, if you can modify it, it would be nice, but unfortunately not the author.

So later, I went to organize my own information, constantly updating and making notes, such as some syntax or other commands, etc. Although the process was a bit troublesome, when I needed to check the information, I directly opened the file and searched for keywords to quickly find them. At the same time, I also saw some of my own remarks. Basically, I could use them immediately after seeing them. 

Today, I would like to share with you the commonly used functions of MySQL in my database, which basically includes the functions I usually use. They have been with me for many years, coming and going in the wind and rain, and sewing and mending for several years.

In order to make them more concise and clear to everyone, I have done a lot of work on the old documents, removing a lot of things that only I can understand, and trying to restore something that everyone can understand. 

At the end of the article, I will also attach my own source files, which can be flexibly modified and annotated on the basis of the files to form my own data notes.
