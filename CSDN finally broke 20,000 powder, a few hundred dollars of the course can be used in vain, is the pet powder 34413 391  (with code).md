First of all, this article does not have marketing, nor does it advertise training institutions, purely celebrating their breakthrough 20,000 fans, pet powder, things can be used in vain. 

I have been preparing for this matter for a long time, I have always wanted to give my fans a free and valuable gift when my CSDN fans break through 10,000 fans, but this gift is not easy to take, has been negotiating, fans came to 20,000 powder, this time must be given!

Let me be blunt. The fan benefit prepared for you this time is the 130-session Python introductory + crawler + data analytics course. Note that it is 130 sessions! Not a dozen sessions of fooling people. 

And it's free to use! 

If you can complete it, you will not only have a solid foundation in Python, but also have the skills of crawlers and data analytics, which are two of the most popular skills.

 The following is the syllabus of the course:  

###  First, this thing is not easy to come by 

I don't have time to specifically record classes for fans, and I haven't recorded them, nor do I have the energy to do them. I have the same idea as many of you. I want to use it for nothing, but I have to avoid copyright issues. 

I negotiated with eight third-party organizations, some directly refused, some asked for my price, and sure enough, there is no free lunch in the world... In the end, I found real-world friends to get in touch, and I got these 130 courses, which can be provided without copyright. 

###  Second, what is the value of this item? 

Since it is used for nothing, is it worthless in itself? 

I can say with certainty that this thing is free to use for the first time on the whole network. Those who spend money may already have these courses, but those who don't spend money definitely don't. 

130 main lessons, with theories and projects in practice, definitely not the kind of things that fool people like more than a dozen lessons, and I don't bother to say that I use these things to tease my fans. If you can learn it, you will have a solid foundation in Python, crawler skills, and data analytics. Of course, it doesn't mean that you have fully mastered crawlers and data analytics after learning these things, but at least crawlers no longer ask for people, multi-threading, anti-picking, etc. The matplotlib, numpy, and pandas commonly used in data analytics are also covered. 

After all, this is for nothing. When you have the ability in the future, you can advance more and learn other things easily.

 If you don't get it this time, you can only wait for the next time I have 100,000 fans, and then I will definitely give you a bigger gift for free use.  

###  III. How to use it for nothing? 

I originally wanted to give the link directly for everyone to use in vain, but I thought it was inappropriate. The link is easy to be F, and after giving it like this, maybe some unruly blogger will take this and send it everywhere. Therefore, if you want to take this thing, please do 2 more operations. 

The first step is to leave a message. 

Leave a message under the comment area of my article "I am an Uncle Long fan, thank you for sharing", and then take a screenshot to prove that you are a fan, not an advertisement. 

Step 2: Find my assistant. 

There are too many things to do these days, so I can't be busy, so I hired a part-time assistant. You can directly ask her for this welfare course, and show her a screenshot of your message to prove that you are a fan.

Alternate QQ: 2590434047 

The participation time ends at 24:00 on June 18th. There are too many people to receive, and my assistant is a little busy, but if you add friends before June 18th, you will finally agree. 

###  IV. Looking back and looking forward 

Since I started writing articles in April, I have received a lot of feedback from fans one after another, met a lot of people, and even caught up with one-third of the people I have known for more than ten years. During the interaction, I felt a lot of emotion. There are friends who are still discussing with each other at two or three o'clock in the middle of the night, aspiring young people who study while working, and college students who are at a loss, etc., which reminds me of a lot of my past experiences and makes me re-examine myself. Originally, writing articles on CSDN and other platforms was just a pastime, but now I have to reposition and plan myself. I hope that in the future, I can write more good articles and give every person who trusts me the help they can.
