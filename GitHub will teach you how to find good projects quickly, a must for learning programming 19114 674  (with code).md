Learn to program and deal with code. If you don't know how to use GitHub, you may need to reinvent it. Many newbies have not yet realized the power of GitHub. Whether it is learning, setting up, or working, they can find many useful project resources on it. 

But finding projects has always been the most troublesome problem for beginners, especially blind search projects, which is even more difficult. So today, teach you a few GitHub tips to quickly find the project you want.

###  Smooth use of GitHub 

Before we start teaching skills, we will help you solve a common problem: web pages open GitHub and circle around, and even many times they cannot be opened. 

Recommend a free gadget, dev-sidecar, on GitHub. 

First open Gitee's website, then enter "dev-sidecar" to search, and click "docmirror/dev-sidecar", which is a tool that can solve the problem of unsmooth website access.

Find "Download and Install Package" in the menu bar, then click "Gitee Release", and then select the version corresponding to your computer system type to download. After the download is completed, start the installation. 

Once you're done, you'll be able to open GitHub stably, and then we'll start learning some tips for finding projects on GitHub. 

###  Second, GitHub's tips for finding projects 

The difference with blind search projects is that you will use tricks to filter out some items you don't want on GitHub and find what you want directly. 

When searching, you can use keywords to search for relevant content, such as using in: name redis, you can search for projects that contain springboot in the project name.

For more excellent and popular projects, the number of stars and forks will be higher. Use the keyword to search for redis stars > = 200 to filter out related projects with more stars and forks than the specified value.

  Obviously, there are not many projects with more than 20,000 stars, only 7. 

When searching blindly, the project you find may be an old project that no one maintains and is in disrepair, so you can add the conditional search of time, such as entering redis pushed: > 2022-01-01

The methods mentioned above can also be mixed and used, and multiple qualifications can be added together to find the item you want in a smaller range. Or take redis as an example to find items after January 1, 2021 with more than 2000 stars and redis in the description. You can search like this: 

in:discription redis stars:>2000 pushed:>2022-01-01 

Finally, we can check the language we want, such as Python, and find projects related to Python that meet the above conditions.

  There are only 15 eligible projects, which is much better than finding a needle in a haystack from hundreds or thousands of projects.
